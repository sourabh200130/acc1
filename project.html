                “Apartment buildings are those structures containing three or more living
                 units with independent cooking and bathroom facilities, whether designated as 
                 apartment houses, condominiums, or garden apartments. Apartments differ from multi-unit
                  residential occupancies that are not considered homes, such as hotels and boarding homes, 
                  by the provision of individual cooking facilities, the number of sleeping rooms, and the less transient nature of the occupants.</td>

            <td id="td2">Outreach marketing is all about being proactive and going out to find new renters. 
                There are definitely some inbound practices involved, but for the most part it’s less about building
                 something and waiting for the renters to come to you, and more about actively seeking them.The biggest
                  benefit of outreach marketing is it typically allows you to get results quicker than “pull” tactics like blogging and SEO. </td>
